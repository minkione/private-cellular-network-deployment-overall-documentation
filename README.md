# Creating an End to End (E2E) Private Cellular Network Testbed

In this repository, I have listed out all my works to create an end-to-end private cellular network testbed using OpenAirInterface and Magma. I have organized all the tasks I did based on the implementations I did for different part of mobile network (User Equipment, Radio Access Network, and Core Network).

## User Equipment
- [Set up user equipment using smartphones](doc/ue/ue.md)
## Radio Access Network
- [Set up eNodeB using OpenAirInterface5g](doc/ran/oai-enodeb.md)
## Core Network 
- [Core Network setup using OpenAirInterface](doc/oai)
- [Core Network setup using Magma Core](doc/magma)

## E2E Overall Setup (Old Documentation)
- [End-to-End Setup using OAI and Magma](https://github.com/nischalaryal/cellular-network-testbed-setup)
