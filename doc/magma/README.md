# Using only Magma Core
Here are the links to all the different scenario and setup while implementing Magma Core.

## End-to-End Testbed creation
- [e2e-setup.md](e2e-setup.md) explains the overall process to create end-to-end cellular network testbed using magma core.

## Pre-requisites setup
[Pre-requisite setup](prerequisite.md) discusses about all the necessary applications we need to setup before working with magma. These include:
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go
- python and pip using pyenv
- Virtual Box
- Vagrant

## Access Gateway (AGW)
- Different Deployment Scenario
  - [In virtual machine](virtual-machine.md)
  - [Docker-based on Bare Metal](docker-based-bare-metal.md)
  - [Setting up Headless AGW](headless-agw.md) - A scenario without Orchestrator
  
## Orchestrator
#TODO: TBD

## Federation Gateway (FeG)
#TODO: TBD
